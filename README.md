## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow(I started with desktop version but transition into mobile last)
- [vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

From this project I learned a lot of things, from getting more used to flexbox, to use in a basic level a javascriptframework like Vuejs.

### Continued development

I would like to keep learning more about Vuejs and its uses in frontend development, in second place I'd like to keep developing my skills translating figma files into css and html, is very fun and feels good to be able to do such thing.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.vuemastery.com/) - This helped me to understand the basics of vue js.
